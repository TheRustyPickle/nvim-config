# Introduction

This is my repository for my neovim configuration files. It is bootstrapped from [ðŸ’¤ LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) with some of my own custom configuration and plugins. I currently use it with the [Noevide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide) client with the latest stable neovim. This is primarily modified for Javascript/Typescript and Rust.
