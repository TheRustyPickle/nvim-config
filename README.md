# Introduction

This is my repository for my neovim configuration files. It is bootstrapped from [ðŸ’¤ LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) with some of my own custom configuration and plugins. I currently use it with the [Noevide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide) client with the latest stable neovim. This is primarily modified for Javascript/Typescript and Rust.

## Modification Highlights

- Autosave on text change
- Rainbow blank line with custom color and indent character
- Rainbow parentheses synced with rainbow blank line
- Custom keymaps for upgrading a single or all Rust crates, viewing version and features in Cargo.toml
- Typo checker using typos
- Modified tsserver LSP settings
- Wakatime plugin
- Autoformat on save has been disabled
- Modified tab space to 4
- Neovide config including cursor blinking, font size, underline thickness
